#DTR: Define the Relationship
Group Member Names: Zach Nager, Mackenzie Frey

##Goals and Expectations for the Project (What does each group member hope to get out of this project? What do we want to achieve as a team? How will we know that we're successful?):
- Learn as much as possible
- Gain confidence in skills/knowledge
- Make project that is polished and would be proud/happy to present as portfolio/resume item
- Complete the required functionality (earn a 3 for each category)

##Team strengths & collaboration styles (consider discussing your Pairin qualities here):
- Mackenzie: Attention to detail. Feels strong about workflow process. Can help review Zach's and offer feedback.
Network - JS specifically and others - able to get help form others when needed.
- Zach: Feel strong technically. Good at keeping eye on timeframe.
- Both like to work independently and then coming together for review. Pairing for review or learning when struggling.
- Both feel strong about keeping project on track and moving forward.

##Schedule Expectations (When are we available to work together and individually? What constraints do we have?):
- At least daily, we will have a in person if possible, slack if not, stand-up to receive previous day/nights work and set clear goals/expectations for the day.
- Mackenzie is trying to stick to stricter time schedule. Typically starts day around 8 am online on weekdays and at Turing until ~6:15. Works until 7. Off computer by 9.
- Zach typically not active before 8am and usually will be working late. But will hopefully try to go to bed earlier.
- Both have plans Friday night and likely at least half of Sunday.

##Communication Expectations (How and often will we communicate? How do we keep lines of communication open? How will we make decisions as a team?):
- Both agree to be strict with agile board use. Assign all tasks and move to in progress whenever working on something and update when appropriate.
- Set specific time box goals after which we peer review and/or ask for help
- Slack is good primary form of communication.
- Try to use PRs and Github process for communication as much as possible. Communicate any github actions with Slack message as well.
- Keep tabs on each other and frequent checkins to keep each other time-boxed and PRs coming.

##Abilities & Growth Expectations (Technical strengths and areas for desired improvement):
- Both: Confidence/familiarity creating micro-services and their communication. Strong documentation practices.
- Zach: Practice testing with Jest. Would like to learn/practice front-end stuff if time allows.
If even more extra time, hosting on AWS. Smaller PRs/more detailed commits.
- Mackenzie: Want to be able to speak to micro-services in interviews. Nice to have: documentation.

##Workload Expectations (What features do we each want to work on?):
- Mackenzie less interested in CI. Zach interested in taking lead.
- No strong feature preference initially.
- Zach has a slight preference for including front-end work as part of extensions.

##Workflow Expectations (Git workflow/Tools/Code Review/Reviewing Pull Requests/Debugging and Problem-solving Techniques):
- Make sure everyone understands all code.
- Mackenzie wants to practice understanding code and then explaining in back. Zach to help enforce that.
- Nobody will merge their own commits; each of us with tag the other in a PR, and once approved, the partner will merge the commit
- Focus on unblocking team members before finishing your own work -- we'll Slack to let each other know something needs review
- Expectation will be that we start project work time with a standup/review session every day, but it will also be an option to bring the group in before classes start in the morning
- As soon as we can each day, we want to sync up and set goals for the next iteration.
- Aim to deploy to Heroku frequently (after every end-point?)

##Expectations for giving and receiving feedback:
- Zach comfortable receiving all kinds of feedback. Would prefer honest, to the point feedback
- Mackenzie wants specific, actionable, kind feedback.
